I am a Principal Researcher at Micro Focus (after the spin-merger of Micro Focus and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Software). I was a part of [Hewlett Packard Labs] (https://www.labs.hpe.com) where I led a group of researchers involved in HPE's [security analytics] ({{< ref "project/securityanalytics.md" >}}) effort, i.e., applying  artificial intelligence (AI), data science, and machine learning (ML) techniques to the enterprise cybersecurity domain. I also worked on hardware-software co-design in the context of securing [The Machine] (https://www.labs.hpe.com/the-machine).

Together with my colleagues in the industry and academia, I have been pursuing a [data (science)] ({{< ref "project/securityanalytics.md" >}}) driven approach to enterprise security. At [Hewlett Packard Labs] (https://www.labs.hpe.com), we conducted research and built enterprise scale machine learning applications for data loss prevention, intrusion detection, location verification, and operational security. At [Symantec Research Labs] (https://www.symantec.com/about/corporate-profile/technology/research-labs), we worked on large scale learning for data loss prevention, malware clustering, and reputation based malware detection. Our research has either improved or created a few [market] (http://www.symantec.com/reputation-based-security/) [leading] (https://www.symantec.com/products/information-protection/data-loss-prevention) [security] ( http://www8.hp.com/us/en/software-solutions/siem-security-information-event-management/)  [products] (http://www8.hp.com/us/en/software-solutions/asset/software-asset-viewer.html?asset=2072201&module=2063668&docname=4AA6-1039ENW&page=2063582).

I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from [Carnegie Mellon University] (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/) where my thesis research formalized the notion of a systemâ€™s [attack surface measurement] ({{< ref "project/attacksurface.md" >}}). I grew up in rural [Odisha] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odisha) and studied Computer Science at [IIT Kanpur] (http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/), India.
