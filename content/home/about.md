<p>
I currently lead a team of senior scientists and engineers focused on driving trust and safety innovations at Meta.
  
Before Meta, I was a part of [Hewlett Packard Labs] (https://www.labs.hpe.com) where I led a group of researchers involved in HPE's [security analytics] ({{< ref "project/securityanalytics.md" >}}) effort. I also worked on hardware-software co-design in the context of securing [The Machine] (https://www.labs.hpe.com/the-machine).

At [Hewlett Packard Labs] (https://www.labs.hpe.com), we conducted research and built enterprise scale machine learning applications for data loss prevention, intrusion detection, location verification, and operational security. At [Symantec Research Labs] (https://www.symantec.com/about/corporate-profile/technology/research-labs), we worked on large scale learning for data loss prevention, malware clustering, and reputation based malware detection. 

I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from [Carnegie Mellon University] (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/) where my thesis research formalized the notion of a systemâ€™s [attack surface measurement] ({{< ref "project/attacksurface.md" >}}). I studied Computer Science at [IIT Kanpur] (http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/), India.
